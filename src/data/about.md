## Welcome

Hello there! I'm currently a PhD student in Cognitive Science at [LaPsyDÉ](https://www.lapsyde.com/home) (CNRS & Université Paris Cité) working under the supervision of [Wim De Neys](https://sites.google.com/site/wimdeneys/), [Zoe Purcell](https://zoepurcell.org/), and [Lucie Charles](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbcs/staff/luciecharles.html).

<br>

My research combines computational modeling, behavioral experimentation, and large language models to investigate the cognitive mechanisms underlying human reasoning. I am especially interested in **how confidence influences the allocation of cognitive effort**, especially in the context of **biased reasoning**.

<br>

I look forward to hearing from you!
